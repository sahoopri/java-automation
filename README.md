Highlight/fail the test for any mismatches.
Framework Details

The above scenario has been automated using serenity-bdd screenplay pattern, cucumber, hamcrest matchers.

The Screenplay Pattern is an approach to writing high quality automated acceptance tests based on good software engineering principles such as the Single Responsibility Principle, the Open-Closed Principle, and effective use of Layers of Abstraction. It encourages good testing habits and well-designed test suites that are easy to read, easy to maintain and easy to extend, enabling teams to write more robust and more reliable automated tests more effectively.

Code Structure

This project can be imported as a maven, or a gradle project in the IDE.

Consists of mainly two folders:

main folder includes actions like reading input and output files which are not tests but tasks. It also includes the Screenplay Question objects which are used to retrieve the actual details from the application. This includes a 'resources' folder to store the input and output files used in this scenario.

test folder includes feature file, step definitions, userInterface classes. It also includes a folder to store the browser drivers for each platform. Please update the browser drivers in this folder based on the browser version and platform. serenity.conf file has system specific and environment specific properties

In order to specify more input files in the test, the file paths can be added in the serenity.conf file and can be referenced in feature files. Please refer input.file.path and output.file.path properties under this file

Commands

Following maven command can be used to run the test in chrome. By default, chrome browser is being used.

mvn clean verify

./gradlew test

In order to run the test in other browsers, please pass the browser driver name like below

mvn clean verify -Dwebdriver.driver=firefox

Note: Please make sure the required drivers are present under /src/test/resources/webdriver folder
